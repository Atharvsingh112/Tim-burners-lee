By chance if u have an anti-virus u wont be able to view the code since your anti-virus think of it as a threat.
Solutions:
1.Switch off ur anti-virus.
(Go to the settings of ur anti-virus.
And most likely u will get an option to turn it off
In the event where u dont get it,Search on youtube on how to turn it off.)
2.Ask a friend to run and see the website while share screening.
